Summary: Evil Hangman is a twisted version of the well known original game Hangman. Like usual the player will select letters to try and guess the selected word by the computer. Now for the twist, there is no selected word. Instead theres an array of all possible words that will be reduced to minimize the players chances of winning.

Note: A dictionary.txt was provided any modifications should follow the same format as that file

-w: word list mode, enable to have every possible word left based off your current guesses

-p: pattern list mode, print all possible patterns based off the current lettes
